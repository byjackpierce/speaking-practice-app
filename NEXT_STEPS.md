# Next Steps

## Immediate Priorities

### 1. Multi-Approach Testing System ðŸ§ª
- Implement 3-4 different transcription approaches simultaneously
- Create user voting interface to rate results
- Build scoring system to track which approaches work best
- **Approaches to test:**
  - Segmented separate (current)
  - Simple Portuguese with smart prompts
  - Auto-detect with context prompts
  - Verbose JSON with confidence scoring

### 2. Whisper API Optimization ðŸŽ¯
- Experiment with different temperature values (0.0-0.3)
- Test various prompt engineering strategies
- Implement verbose JSON format for better timing/confidence
- **Key parameters to test:**
  - `language`: 'pt', 'en', 'auto'
  - `prompt`: Different context instructions
  - `temperature`: 0.0, 0.1, 0.3
  - `response_format`: 'text' vs 'verbose_json'

### 3. Performance Comparison & Analysis ðŸ“Š
- Track processing times for each approach
- Compare transcription accuracy and grammar quality
- Analyze user voting patterns over time
- **Metrics to track:**
  - Processing speed (API calls, total time)
  - Transcription accuracy (user votes)
  - Grammar flow quality
  - Translation quality

### 4. Enhanced User Experience ðŸŽ¨
- Side-by-side comparison interface (implemented)
- Real-time processing feedback
- Confidence scoring display
- **Features to add:**
  - Confidence indicators for each segment
  - Processing progress indicators
  - Export comparison results

### 5. Database for Experimentation ðŸ“ˆ
- Store test results and user votes
- Track performance metrics over time
- Enable data-driven approach selection
- **Data to collect:**
  - User votes (good/bad) for each approach
  - Processing times and success rates
  - Audio characteristics (duration, language mix)

## Technical Notes
- **Current Status**: âœ… Parallel API calls implemented, comparison interface working
- **Performance**: Simple approach ~3-5x faster than segmented (1 vs N API calls)
- **Quality Trade-off**: Simple approach translates Englishâ†’Portuguese, segmented keeps English separate
- **Next Phase**: Focus on data collection and user feedback to optimize approach selection

## Research Questions
- **Whisper Segmentation**: Should we use Whisper's natural segmentation vs manual spacebar?
- **Language Detection**: Can we automatically detect language segments without manual input?
- **Confidence Scoring**: How to use Whisper's confidence scores to improve results?
- **Prompt Engineering**: What prompts work best for mixed-language learning scenarios?
