## **Real-Time Flashcard Generation Flow:**

### **1. Progressive Processing**
- User records for ~1 minute (4 sentences)
- **Instead of waiting** for full transcript completion
- **Process sentences incrementally** as they're transcribed

### **2. Sentence-by-Sentence Translation**
- **When a sentence ends** (period detected) → immediately send for translation
- **Flashcards appear progressively** while other sentences are still being processed
- **No waiting** for the entire recording to finish

### **3. Continuous Recording Support**
- User can **stop → start → stop → start** multiple times
- **Background processing** continues while user records new content
- **Accumulated flashcards** build up over multiple recording sessions
- **Final result**: User has many flashcards ready without waiting

### **4. Example Timeline:**
```
Minute 1: User records 4 sentences → Stop
├── Sentence 1 processed → Flashcard appears immediately
├── Sentence 2 processed → Flashcard appears
├── Sentence 3 processed → Flashcard appears  
└── Sentence 4 processed → Flashcard appears

Minute 2: User starts recording again → 3 more sentences
├── Previous processing continues in background
├── New Sentence 1 → Flashcard appears
├── New Sentence 2 → Flashcard appears
└── New Sentence 3 → Flashcard appears

Minute 3: User stops → All processing completes
Result: 7 flashcards ready to review
```

**This eliminates the waiting time and makes the app feel much more responsive!**

**Is this the flow you had in mind?**
